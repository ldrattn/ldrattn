Installation steps:
1. ssh to raspberry pi target board 
ssh pi@192.168.0.195
passwd: raspberry

2.Become super user 
sudo su -

3.create a directory on target board.
> git init
> git pull https://github.com/ldrattn/ldrattn.git
> cd wiringpi/APP
> make ; make install
> cp ../../scripts/ldrattnapp /etc/init.d/

Test setup:

We need two terminals looged in to raspberry pi target board. On one terminal run the server(ldrattnapp)
and on second terminal run the  client application(client).
 
1. ssh to raspberry pi target board 
ssh pi@192.168.0.195
passwd : raspberry

2.Become super user 
sudo su -

3. cd /usr/src/LDRAPP/APP
4. run ldrattnapp 
5. run client app (/usr/src/LDRAPP/APP/client).
6. The client runs set of commands for example
   to start calibrartion, ./client -C -i 10 -s 48 

7. we can check the usage of client, by running ./client --help
Usage: ./client
        -C start calibrartion
	-V set volume
	-R reload configuration
	-S save calibration
	-T temperature compenstaion
	-W write configuration
	-B set balance update
	-s arg number of calibrarion steps
	-b arg balance value
	-c arg balance channel
	-i arg impedance
	-v arg volume to be set 


a) Start calibration: 
./client -C -i 10 -s 48 . here -i is the impedance and -s is the number of steps 
b) Save calibration:
	 ./client -S  . This comamnd invokes the ldrattnapp to save  the calibrated values to a file in directory /usr/local/etc/ldrattn/csv .

c) Write configuration:
 ./client -W -s 20 -i 30 -v  32 -c 1 -b 1 -t 25
 writes to configuration file with steps 20,impedance 30,default volume 32,balanace channel right,balance value 1 and temperature 25 degree. The configuration file is located in path /usr/local/etc/ldrattn/ldrattn.conf

d) Set volume: ./client -V -v 30
  This sets the volume to 30the step  value of calibrartion.
e) Reload configuration: 
  ./client -R
   This reloads the configuration.
h) Balance Update: 
  ./client -B -c 1 -b 1
   This command changes the balance value for left and right channel.
   -c channel to  set,  right (1) and for left (0) 
   -b balance value to be set is 1

i) Temperature compensate: 
   ./client -T -t 25
   -t temperature set to 25degree
